		I started work at Delphix right out of university, beginning as a QE automation engineer. While
		in QE, I worked largely with either backend tests in Java or UI tests in selenium with python.
		Eventuallly I gravitated to managing the infrastructure for our selenium tests, including
		upgrading the version (and all affected tests). One of the main benefits of upgrading the
		version was allowing me to change our system from a static host to dynamic hosting and load
		balancing with docker containers.

	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-3">
		Through my work in UI testing, I then changed over the joining the UI team as a developer,
		working in angular on new product features. The main benefit of working in UI was my access to
		the backend team that we were co-developing features with, eventually leading me to learn and
		develop some of the features myself in a fullstack manner. After about a year of this, I
		transitioned to fully backend, working on the new cloud deployment/managemnt product which was
		written in both Java and Python across several docker containerized services. Here I made the
		most impact in the company, by contributing to the leading edge product, owning legacy product,
		and managing the UI infrastructure at the same time.

		While hired on for test automation, my contribution over the summer was overhauling the internal
		"blackbox" automation test kick-off center. What was handed to me as a django and js script to
		interface with Jenkins' API ended the summer as being able to kick off multiple runs in
		parallel, link existing Jira errors to failed runs, and had more extensive run options.

	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		The start of my testing and test automation career. Initially interns were only expected to
		participate in "Golden Run" tests, these being a giant excel doc that you would repeatedly go
		through for each release. Partway through I introduced a proof of concept UI test automation
		that peaked the lead of QA's interest.

	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		My introduction to internships, while the main project I was given was about server load
		balancing I ended up creating switch bandwith tests instead. This was also where I learned about
		python/ruby and several other languages for the first time, in conjunction with the "iperf"
		command. Aside from accidentally ddos'ing the internal router with some bad IPs, things went
		alright.
