	<p class="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
		A command line based program that interfaced with MAL's APIs, back when those were available.
		The program allowed users to read their current list, and select and modify specific series.
		This was borne from the necessity of dealing with extremely limited internet bandwidth in
		university, where the API calls were cheap but the full website was not.
